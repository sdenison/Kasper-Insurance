    Life insurance has several variables, including type of insurance, duration of coverage, frequency and stability of payments, payout method and amount of coverage. Term 
    insurance is the most basic and usually least costly type of life insurance. It’s usually best for people under age 50, and it’s written for a specific period of time, 
    typically between 10 and 30 years. There are several other types of insurance as well, including declining balance term insurance, whole life, universal life and variable 
    life. We’re happy to go through each type and option with you to ensure you get the best and most affordable life insurance for your needs and budget.

    How much life insurance should you purchase? Good question. People often purchase life insurance based on income replacement. For example, one could purchase enough insurance 
    to replace his or her salary for five to 10 years, but it’s also important to consider any large expenditures, like college tuition for children or paying down debts.
